## About The Project 

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](./assets/images/screenshot.png)

### User asked:

AS an employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

### Criteria:

* GIVEN I need a new, secure password 
* WHEN I click the button to generate a password 
* THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria 
* WHEN prompted for password criteria 
* THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
* WHEN prompted for the length of the password
* THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
* WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
* THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* WHEN I answer each prompt
* THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
* WHEN all prompts are answered
* THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
* WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

### What was done.

Password generator was crated with a quick pop up messages to ask for a password from 8 to 128 characters. once user selectes this options are displayed for leter caps, numbers and special charaters. 
password will be displayed in the password text bos and also automatically copied in the user clipboard. 


Thank you for taking time looking at this page.

Happy painting!
